To form the first set, 20 words are sampled without replacement from the test sample (unseen by the classifier). To form the second set, the kth word is chosen randomly from all words in the test fold having the same length as 3In this paper, we treat these three different sensors as three different dimensions without further exploiting their physical properties. the kth word of the first set. Since every fold of the data was used 9 times in the training phase and once in the testing phase, and since we use a high number of randomized comparisons, this averages out biases in the accuracy estimation. Classifying sets of 20 words improves the classification accu- racy greatly while lowering its variance and makes For each subject, the experiment data consists therefore of a 306 dimensional time series of length 45 minutes. We averaged the signal in ev- ery sensor into 100ms non-overlapping time bins. Since words were presented for 500ms each, we therefore obtain for every word p = 3065 val- ue"
2025-08-25 13:25:33,explain what this document is about in a single para.,"We present here a novel and revealing approach to shed light on the brain processes involved in reading. This is a departure from the classical approach of control- ling for a few variables in the text (e.g. showing ing, 2012). The participants were native English speakers and right handed. They were chosen to be familiar with the material: we made sure they had read the Harry Potter books or seen the movies series and were familiar with the characters and the story. All the participants signed the consent form, which was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, and were compensated for their participation. The words of the story were presented one by one at the center of the screen for 0.5 seconds each. The text was shown in 4 experimental blocks of 11 minutes. In total, 5176 words were presented. Chapter 9 was presented in its entirety without modifications and each subject read the chapter only once. One can think of an MEG machine as a large helmet, with sensors located on the helmet that 237 ling for a few variables in the text (e.g. showing a sentence with an expected target word versus an unexpected one). While we cannot make clear cut causal claims because we did not"
